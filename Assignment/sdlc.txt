The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used for developing software applications. 
It involves several phases to ensure the systematic creation, deployment, and maintenance of software. The main stages include:

1.Planning: Define project goals, scope, and feasibility.
2.Requirements Analysis: Gather and document user needs and technical requirements.
3.Design: Create system architecture, design database and user interfaces.
4.Implementation: Write code and build the software according to design specifications.
5.Testing: Verify functionality, find bugs, and ensure quality.
6.Deployment: Release the software to the production environment.
7.Maintenance: Provide updates, fix issues, and enhance features post-release.

SDLC helps ensure high-quality software that meets user expectations.


A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is a comprehensive description of the system to be developed. 
It details the functional and non-functional requirements, as well as any constraints or assumptions. 
The SRS serves as a blueprint for the software development process, providing a clear understanding between stakeholders, developers, and testers.

Importance of an SRS Document:

*Clear Understanding: Provides clarity on what the system should do, ensuring that all stakeholders have the same vision.
* Foundation for Design and Development: Serves as a baseline for system design, helping developers build the system according to specifications.
* Reduces Ambiguity: Clearly defines functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability).
* Reference for Testing: Testers use the SRS to validate whether the developed system meets the outlined requirements.
* Improves Communication: Acts as a communication tool between developers, clients, and other stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.
* Scope Management: Helps manage scope by documenting what the system should include, reducing the risk of scope creep.
* Legal Agreement: Can serve as a formal agreement between the client and the development team on the final product’s deliverables.

Contents of an SRS Document:

* Introduction (Purpose, Scope, Definitions)
* Overall Description (System Perspective, Constraints)
* Functional Requirements
* Non-functional Requirements (Usability, Performance, Security)
* Use Cases or User Scenarios
* Assumptions and Dependencies

The SRS is crucial for ensuring that all parties are aligned and that the software development process is efficient and effective.

3. Differences Between Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Acceptance
Testing
● Unit Testing:
	○ Tests individual components or methods in isolation, ensuring each part functions correctly.
	○ Focuses on testing small pieces of code, typically written by developers.
	○ Example: Testing a function that calculates a discount percentage without any dependencies on other modules.
● Integration Testing:
	○ Tests how different modules or components work together.
	○ Ensures data flows correctly across interfaces and that modules interact as expected.
	○ Example: After testing the discount function, you would test it with the billing module to ensure the final calculation is correct.
● Acceptance Testing:
	○ Validates the entire system against business requirements and is often performed by end-users.
	○ Ensures the software meets user needs and functions as expected in real-world scenarios.
	○ Example: A retailer tests the entire sales system, including discounts, taxes, and billing, to confirm it works as intended for end-users.


4. Classical Waterfall Model
 The Waterfall Model is a traditional software development model where each phase is completed sequentially.
● Phases:
	○ Requirement Analysis: Collects requirements to form a detailed SRS document.
	○ System Design: Based on the SRS, the system is architected and designed.
	○ Implementation: The design is coded into the actual software product.
	○ Integration and Testing: Tests are conducted to verify functionality and system integration.
	○ Deployment: The final product is delivered to the user environment.
	○ Maintenance: Post-deployment support to address any issues or enhancements.
● Limitations:
	○ Lack of flexibility makes it hard to adapt if requirements change mid-project.
	○ Works best when requirements are clear from the beginning, which is rare in complex, evolving projects.
● Use Cases: Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and limited
changes, such as smaller internal tools or embedded systems.


5. Project Planning

Project planning involves creating a roadmap for completing a project within defined constraints of scope, time, and cost.
● Components of Project Planning:
	○ Scope Definition: Identifies what is included in the project and what is not.
	○ Task Breakdown: Divides the project into tasks and sub-tasks (often represented as a Work Breakdown Structure).
	○ Scheduling: Defines timelines, deadlines, and milestones.
	○ Resource Allocation: Assigns roles, responsibilities, and resources to each task.
	○ Budgeting: Estimates costs associated with resources and time.
	○ Risk Management: Identifies potential risks and plans mitigation strategies.
● Importance:
	○ A solid project plan helps manage time, costs, and quality, ensuring successful project delivery.
	○ Mitigates the risk of scope creep, missed deadlines, and budget overruns.


6. Risks Associated with Software Development:

1. Scope Creep: Uncontrolled changes to the project scope cause delays and budget overruns.
2. Unclear Requirements: Vague requirements lead to misunderstandings and rework.
3. Technology Risk: Using new technologies may cause technical issues or obsolescence.
4. Project Delays: Unexpected problems push deadlines.
5. Budget Overruns: Costs exceed the allocated budget.
6. Inadequate Testing: Insufficient testing leads to bugs and low-quality software.
7. Team Skill Gaps: Lack of necessary skills causes poor implementation.
8. Security Risks: Vulnerabilities may lead to data breaches or attacks.
9. third-Party Dependencies: External tools or services may cause delays or failures.
10. Client Communication Issues: Poor communication results in misaligned expectations.
11.Post-Release Issues: Performance problems or bugs appear after deployment.

Risk management is crucial to minimize these issues and ensure successful project outcomes.
